# Nuklei Benchmarks

Various benchmarks for Nuklei components using [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) as a harness.

## Running Benchmarks

The benchmarks are placed inside an executable jar, called `benchmarks.jar`, in the `target` directory.

To list the benchmarks:

    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -l
    
To get help from JMH for command line parameters:

    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar -h
